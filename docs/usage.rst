Usage examples
==============
.. include:: note.rst

As the lmfitxps package is in many aspects an extension to the lmfit package, its `documentation <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/intro.html>`_. is a great starting point for getting started with lmfitxps.
The :ref:`BGModels` as well as the :ref:`PeakModels` are implemented like the `lmfit build-in models <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/builtin_models.html>`_ and can be used in a similar manner.
